        <b>General Data Overview</b><br>

        <p><b>Spirit Talker</b><br>
        
        Spirit Talker Beyond generates words and speech based on your phone's sensor data. While designed for entertainment purposes only, it does not possess genuine ghost-detecting capabilities. Given the speculative nature of the paranormal, the words generated are not directives and should not influence significant decisions. Developer guidance is not implied.
        </p>
        <p><b>Face Recognition</b><br>
        
        For Beards in 3D, no face data is stored during face recognition. The app only detects faces to properly locate beards or mustaches. Similarly, in photo filtering, no face data is saved, as the app merely utilizes depth maps for foreground or background recognition. Filters incorporating Artificial Intelligence do not store face data, ensuring non-disclosure to third parties. Hairstyle apps use standard face recognition libraries without storing face data.
        </p>
        <p><b>TrueDepth API Usage</b><br>
        
        We solely use the TrueDepth API to position images and do not collect any information through it. Face detection and depth mapping do not result in stored face data, ensuring non-sharing with third parties.
        </p>
